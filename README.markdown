# QR Code for CommonSpot Events

This is an HTML/Javascript snippet to generate a QR code in a small overlay on an event page on the Santa Clara University's [Career Center Calendar](http://scu.edu/careercenter/event.cfm). The overlay is triggered from a keydown event window (defaults to 'q').

## Features
* Provides a QR that directs a user to the event mobile SCU calendar.
* Integrated Google Analytics campaign statistics allow for tracking across departments and advertising medias.
* Codes are resizable up to 400x400 pixels.

## Usage
1. To include the QR code generator, add a custom script element anywhere on your events page and set the script path to "/careercenter/customcf/live-qr.cfm".
2. Submit your page and press 'q'!
